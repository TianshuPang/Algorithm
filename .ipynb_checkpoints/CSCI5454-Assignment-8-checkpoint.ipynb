The numbers are in base 10, where each number contains $m+n$ digits and each digit corresponds to either one variable or one clause. Label all the digits as $a_1,\\cdots,a_m, b_1,\\cdots,b_n$, $a_i$ are for variables and $b_i$ are for clauses.  For __variable__ $x_i$, define integers $u_i$ and $\\neg ui$ as follows:  $a_i$ of both $u_i$ and $\\neg u_i$ is 1 and for all other digits $a_j , j != i$, are 0;  $b_k$ of $u_i$ is 1 if and only if $x_i$ appears in clause $C_k$;  $b_k$ of $\\neg u_i$ is 1 if and only if $\\neg x_i$ appears in clause $C_k$.
